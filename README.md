Overview
BookCrossing is the act of releasing your books "into the wild" for a stranger to find, or via "controlled release" to another BookCrossing member, and tracking where they go via journal entries from around the world. Our community of 1,951,800 passionate, generous book-lovers is changing the world and touching lives, one traveling book at a time.
